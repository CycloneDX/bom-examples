# CycloneDX BOM Examples
CycloneDX was designed from the ground-up to be a Bill of Materials (BOM) format, capable of capturing complex inventory 
information for a wide range of cybersecurity and software supply chain use cases.

This repository contains example CycloneDX Bill of Materials (BOM) created from various open source projects. Examples 
are categorized by different BOM types including:
